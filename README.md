 PC accounts password manager

 This is a console app that let the user manage all the accounts information like:
 - Username
 - Password
 - Origin (where the account is used i.e. Google)
 - Email

 The capabilities for the user are:
 1. Create accounts
 2. Find accounts information based on values or requested strings
 3. Erase information
 4. Edit account information

 Dont be worry. The information is stored in the PC file system encripted with a key that only the app can use to decript the accounts data when the user is logged in
